# mock-social-network

University project built with JavaFX and Postgres. It follows a layered architectural model and a mvc for the user interface. 

It's not perfect due to wanting to develop it quickly and adapt it to constantly changing requirements. 
The whole project is based on java streams, which might not be the best choice for performance, but it is a good one for quick development.
